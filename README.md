# ButtonStats
ButtonStats is a socket client-server app for collecting statistics on instant and average typing speed. The client part collects keyboard input data, and the server part displays statistics.

The application was written to study the :rocket:**reactive**:rocket: style in interface development. As a reactive library, I used a ReactiveUI combined with WPF.
